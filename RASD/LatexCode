\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Purpose}
{The purpose of our project is to inform, to involve and to help communities potentially affected by environmental rubbish pollution by means of a web application for desktop and a mobile application. \\

Rubbish pollution is a public health issue according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and other leading research bodies:

\begin{quotation}
\small{\textit{“Management of waste is a demanding and challenging undertaking in all European countries, with important implications for human health and well-being, environmental preservation, sustainability and economy.”} - WHO, Regional Office for Europe, 2007}\\

\small{\textit{“Improper waste management and illegal waste shipments can have negative impacts on both environment and public health.”} - WHO Regional Office for Europe, Waste and human health,2015}
\end{quotation}\\

Litter is any kind of trash thrown in small amounts, especially in places where it doesn’t belong. With time, it heaps up. 
The practice is unlawful because it costs municipalities millions of dollars annually in cleanup costs. It also portrays a bad picture of an area. 
The most frequent littered stuff includes fast food packaging, cigarette butts, used drink bottles, chewing gum wrappers, broken electrical equipment parts, toys, broken glass, food scraps or green wastes.
Even practices such as leaving items overflowing beside a dustbin, deliberate throwing of items from vehicles, and abandoning items or wrappers by the roadside qualifies as littering. Littering is a dangerous activity and should not be taken lightly because it impacts the environment in multiple ways.\\

\subsection{Goals of the Application}
{The client is the Public Administration.\\ 
PA wants to create a modern and efficient information system by the help of the citizens, in order to enter, access, retrieve, analyze, visualize and modify, by means of an interactive mapping tool, the available ERP data of a certain local area.\\

Given data about litter for a certain Public Administration, the main goal is to improve the management of garbage collection in the municipality, for example by putting a bin or an infographic in a critical area (critical areas are found by statistical analysis implemented in the application). 

A low level goal is to improve the behaviour of people according to the environment and rubbish pollution.\\

Therefore, we received the request to design and implement the application
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=30mm,scale=0.1]{logo.png}
\end{center}
which has basically two great objectives:
\begin {itemize}
\item \ create the database
\item \ help in the decision making process
\end{itemize}
}
\subsection{Users and Interfaces of the Application}
{The system is designed to interact with three kind of users: 
\begin {itemize}
\item \ The Citizen\footnote{We consider a Citizen every person who wants to contribute in collecting garbage data. They can be citizens of the city, tourists or simply visitors of the city/park.}
\item \ The Public Administration
\item \ The Garbage Collector
\end{itemize}
For each category of user we must provide an appropriate interface and the client requests for the interfaces are:
\begin {itemize}
\item \ A mobile application for the citizens and  the Garbage Collector
\item \ A web application for Public Administration
\end{itemize}

{\textbf{Citizen}: this user should  provide data about garbage distribution on the territory. It should feel free to use the application at any moment and without any constraint, such as a registration to the application, and he should perceive it to be helpful for his own surroundings not only for the entire community. For this reason the registration would not be required and we would refer to the application as something that someone could use for the preservation of his own neighbourhood. To convey this idea to the user we would use a sentence once the mobile app is opened such as: 
\begin{quotation}
\textit{The whole world is one neighbourhood. _{Franklin D. Roosevelt}}

\textit{Let's start from \textbf{yours}}!
\end{quotation}\\

\textbf{Garbage collector}: this user is a public administration employee and he is in charge of cleaning the bins. Once he has cleaned a bin he can visualize the bins distribution on a map and his position and select the bin he has just cleaned and reports if it was overfull.\\

\textbf{Public Administration}: it receives data from the Citizens and the garbage collectors. It can visualize data distribution and use the application to improve the management of garbage, distribution of bins and to improve Citizen behaviour by putting (if necessary) infographic about the impact  that littering has on the environment. The app, by making statistical analysis of data entered by the Citizens, reports the critical areas where a bin or an infographic is needed; in this way the application helps Public Administration in the decision making process. If the application reports an area as a critical one, Public Administration will allocate there a bin or an infographic and then it will enter new data about this in the database about distribution of bins on the territory. This user should be able to visualize the data and decide to put another bin in a location where there is already one if it is reported to be overfull with a certain frequency by Garbage Collector.
}
}

\subsection{Dataset Description}
{The dataset of environmental rubbish pollution measurements that will be used in this project comes from Epicollect5 and contains data collected in Australia. The dataset consists of  georeferenced measurement points of ERP.\\

Dataset:\\
{\small{\url{https://five.epicollect.net/project/ev2502-5505-datacollection/data}}}\\

The main features of the epicollect dataset are summarized in Table 1.1:

\item \ GC visualizes data about bins on the interactive map and finds the data corresponding to his position and click on it
\item \ BinEco responds by presenting him a pop-up 
\item \ GC activates the “Update condition of bin” function on its terminal
\item \ BinEco responds by presenting a form to GC
\item \ GC updates the status of bin table\footnote{The attribute \texit{ID code} is automatically filled in by the software (for each GC, the ID code is linked directly to his password and username). PA thanks to the ID code knows which GC has updated data.}:

\section{Requirements}
{We divide the functional requirements of the application by the user class (actors) which are (mainly) involved in it.}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
{\begin {itemize}
\item \ Public Administration:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit {R.PA.1} The system must allow user registration
    \item \textit {R.PA.2} The system must allow user authentication
    \item \textit {R.PA.3} The system must allow user to visualize data on an interactive map
    \item \textit{R.PA.4} The system must allow authenticated users to make query on data
    \item \textit {R.PA.5} The system must allow authenticated users to edit database tables (update bin/infographic)
    \item \textit {R.PA.6} the system must allow user to download data
    \item \textit {R.PA.7} The system must allow authenticated user to make query on data and visualize the results on an interactive map
    \item \textit {R.PA.8} The system must guarantee multiple users to access it concurrently
\end{itemize}

\item \ Citizen:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit {R.C.1} The system must allow any users to load a new data by filling a form
    \item \textit {R.C.2} The system must guarantee multiple users to access it concurrently
\end{itemize}

\item \ Garbage Collector:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit {R.GC.1} The system must allow user registration
    \item \textit {R.GC.2} The system must allow user authentication
    \item \textit {R.GC.3} The system must allow user to visualize data on an interactive map
    \item \textit {R.GC.4} The system must allow authenticated users to edit database tables (update status of bin table)
    \item \textit {R.GC.5} The system must guarantee multiple users to access it concurrently
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}

\subsection{Non Functional Requirements}
{\begin {itemize}
\item \ Available 24/7
\item \ The system has to provide a feedback in 5 sec
\end{itemize}}

\section{Domain Assumptions}
{\begin{itemize}
\item \textit {D.A.1} For each data, details about litter are correctly entered
\item \textit {D.A.2} Accurate litter’s locations are known by GPS
\item \textit {D.A.3} Each smartphone used by Citizen and GC has a GPS system installed and the application has the privilege to access it
\item \textit {D.A.4} PA has already an organized database of distribution of bins on territory
\item \textit {D.A.5} GC correctly reports if bin is overfull
\item \textit {D.A.6} When the software defines a critical area, bin/infographic is allocated there by PA in a certain amount of time
\item \textit {D.A.7} When bin/infographic is allocated in critical zone by PA, database of distribution of bins on territory is immediately correctly updated
\item \textit {D.A.8} GC are referred to by the corresponding PA using a personal ID code
\item \textit {D.A.9} PA provides each GC with specific username and password (and ID code)
\end{itemize}}

\chapter{Effort Spent}
{This document was written in a total amount of around 30 hours divided so between the four
group elements:
\begin{itemize}
Elisa \textsc{Servidio} : 8 hours\\
Dorotea \textsc{Rigamonti} : 8 hours\\
Mohammad \textsc{Mahdi Safari} : 7 hours\\
Surendhiran \textsc{Sundaraj} : 7 hours\\
\end{itemize}
The four group elements were not in charge of a particular section/chapter but everyone worked
together at the whole document.
